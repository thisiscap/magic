# Magic 8 Ball

A digital magic 8 ball

**To do list**

- ~~Get JS functionaliity working~~
- ~~Initial styling~~
- ~~Make values of motion keyframes random~~
- ~~Find a way to add depth, blur in text with `filter` perhaps?~~
- Refine typography, find a suitable webfont?
- Explore way to make animations less taxing on devices (probably caused by filter animation, perhaps make this a transition instead)
- Have the triangle end at a random angle (subtle) rather than vertically straight
- Use javascript to pull from accelerometer feedback to 'shake' for an answer?
